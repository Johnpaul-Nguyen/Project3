This project's objective is to implement a novel templated queue data structure called
NovelQueue in C++. This queue will simulate a CPU scheduling system, managing a collection of
CPU jobs and their execution characteristics.

In real-world computing environments, operating systems use CPU scheduling algorithms to
determine the order in which jobs (processes) are executed. This project simulates this concept by
allowing students to manipulate a queue of CPU jobs with various attributes, including priority, job
type, CPU time consumed, and memory consumption. By doing so, students will gain a practical
understanding of how efficient CPU scheduling is critical for optimizing system performance and
managing system resources.

The goal of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in:
• Implementing and working with linked list-based data structures.
• Using templates in C++ to handle generic data.
• Applying sorting and searching algorithms within the context of job scheduling.
• Gaining a deeper understanding of how queue management impacts CPU scheduling
efficiency.
• Practicing memory management by dynamically allocating and deallocating job records.

By designing and implementing the NovelQueue, students will explore how scheduling decisions can
be made dynamically in response to job attributes, such as priority and resource consumption. This
project mirrors key concepts in operating system design, particularly those related to process
management, reinforcing both data structure knowledge and systems programming principles.
